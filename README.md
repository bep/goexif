## This is about READING image metadata

Writing is not supported, and never will.

I welcome PRs with fixes, but please raise an issue first if you want to add new features.

## Performance

Extracting `EXIF` performs well, ref. the benhcmark below. Note that you can get a significant boost if you only need a subset of the fields (e.g. only the `Orientation`). The last line is with the library that [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) used before it was replaced with this.

```bash
BenchmarkDecodeExif/bep/imagemeta/exif/jpg/alltags-10              69238             17702 ns/op            4418 B/op        167 allocs/op
BenchmarkDecodeExif/bep/imagemeta/exif/jpg/orientation-10         302263              3831 ns/op             650 B/op         19 allocs/op
BenchmarkDecodeExif/rwcarlsen/goexif/exif/jpg/alltags-10           25791             47415 ns/op          175548 B/op        812 allocs/op
```

Looking at some more extensive tests, testing different image formats and tag sources, we see that the current XMP implementation leaves a lot to be desired (you can provide your own XMP handler if you want). 

```bash
BenchmarkDecode/bep/imagemeta/png/exif-10                  23444             50991 ns/op            4425 B/op        168 allocs/op

## When in doubt, Exiftools is right

The output of this library is tested against `exiftool -n -json`. This means, for example, that:

*  We use f-numbers and not APEX for aperture values.
*  We use seconds and not APEX for shutter speed values.
*  EXIF field definitions are fetched from this table:  https://exiftool.org/TagNames/EXIF.html
*  IPTC field definitions are fetched from this table:  https://exiftool.org/TagNames/IPTC.html
*  The XMP handling is currently very simple, you can supply your own XMP handler (see the `HandleXMP` option) if you need more.

## Development

Many of the tests depends on generated golden files. To update these, run:

```bash
 go generate ./gen
```

Note that you need a working `exiftool` and updated binary in your `PATH` for this to work. This was tested OK with:

```
exiftool -ver
12.76
```
